The Office Trivia Game

    I decided to create this trivia game because I'm a fan of the show and i thought it would be good practice for me.

Some of the things I wanted the game to do was:

    -Have multiple choice
    -Keep score
    -Do some type of hover function with the answer choices
    -Game needs to restart after last question

    I had a few obstacles along the way. One of them was getting my answers to show up correctly in my buttons I created.
    I used a 'for loop' to solve my problem. Scoring was also a little challenging for me. I had trouble getting the score
    to read the way I wanted. My problem ended up being that i was trying to append the user's score to a 'div. I got rid
    of the append code and had the div's innerText = userScore and it seems to work now. I also spent a lot of time on the
    css styling. The background image took time to get to look right. Ultimately, i had to refer to google. 

    It was a fun project and I plan on adding additional features later.
